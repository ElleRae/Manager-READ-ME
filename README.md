# Manager-READ-ME

## Introduction

Hi! My name is Danielle (or Elle like the letter L), and I look forward to getting to know you. I am currently a Fractional Head of Product, UX/UI, and Design. With over 25 years of experience in design, user experience, accessibility, and product management, I have worked across various industries, from law enforcement software to healthcare, and I’m passionate about creating products that delight users while being inclusive and accessible. 

The purpose of this document is to summarize some of the values and principles I try to adhere to at work. But I am human, and this isn’t a contract but a relationship we’ll build upon. This is a way to introduce how we can work together, and I’m excited to hear from you.

I understand that companies often have their employees create documents like this and they’re misused and misinterpreted. If you see me doing something that isn’t reflective of these values, please call me out so that I can improve (preferably when it happens and not at an annual review).

Let’s go!

## My Team Philosophy

I believe teams do their best work in a safe, trusting, respectful, and fulfilling environment. The most important thing I learned at Google is that the perks don’t matter, it’s all about the people. The person will always be more important than the project or the politics. 

I am here to be your partner, to listen, to brainstorm, to coach, to help clarify, interpret between teams, provide context, to listen to your feedback, understand it, and work through issues together. All done with the goal of making the team successful. 

I want everyone on the team to be excited to come to work (or get in front of the computer screen). I love what I do and I like to surround myself with people who are as passionate as I am.

When my team is happy and successful, I know that the business and customers will also be happy and successful. If I’m making a decision that you think will put that in jeopardy, tell me. I want to get better but I can only do that if I know when I’m veering off course.

Success is all but guaranteed if:
-	The team is happy, loves what they’re doing, and what we’re doing as a company.
-	And if our customers feel welcomed and listened to.

## My Leadership Philosophy

In Taoism, there's a concept called wu wei, which means "effortless action" or "non-action." It teaches that the most effective approach often comes from being in tune with the natural flow of the situation, rather than imposing rigid control. I see this as a guiding principle for my leadership—helping teams to act with fluidity and responsiveness to the challenges they face, without forcing solutions.

My role as a leader is to provide strategy, goals, and context to teams, then step back and trust the right actions to emerge. I trust teams to come up with the best ways to accomplish our goals through the product. While I am ultimately accountable for the outcomes, I remain closely involved in the details, providing guidance and context through questions and suggestions, rather than imposing top-down mandates. I like to surround myself with a team that knows things I don’t, that are specialists in their niche, and that I know can do the job.

And if they don’t know how, I trust that they will figure it out.

If the reason behind what’s being asked is unclear, or if you feel like necessary context is lacking to do your job well, please let me know. The why behind what we do is essential for our success.

I believe in matching strategy and process to the team context. I’m not rigid about frameworks or methods. I like to understand how teams get things done, codify what works well, and collaboratively improve. Here are some principles I’ve found success with:

-	I prefer transparency and context over ‘do as I say.’
-	I prefer roadmaps that take detours into consideration.
-	I prefer functional specifications that dive deep into understanding the Why, rather than jumping straight into implementation details.

## Communication Preferences

I prefer to read or review documents during deep work time so I can provide thoughtful feedback. For non-urgent communication, I prefer email over phone calls or instant messages. I prefer instant messages over video calls. 

I’m not saying I don’t like video meetings, you can get a lot from watching someone during a meeting. I prefer meetings for things that need to be done with others. I enjoy having a one-on-one discussion regularly with my team members and with my leaders. It’s not just a time to share what we’ve been working on but to share what’s going on in our outside lives.

Work life balance is truly signing off at the end of the day. Not answering emails on the weekend. Not expecting the team to be up at 11 PM for a call. I understand those times may happen, but I believe that to be your best at work, you need to be your best at home.

When I was at Centene, I offered my team extreme flex time. They could work whatever hours they needed to during the week as long as they were there for core hours at least three days a week (10-3 CST). That allowed two people to work four days a week, one worked 8 hours a day but took between 9-11 AM off and sometimes altered those times so he could take a long weekend to camp with his family. I had another employee who preferred the consistency of working each day. The flexibility to take time off as needed, to step away and take a breather or just to think, the assurance that the work will be there tomorrow and so will your job was invaluable.

I may send something at a late hour on Zoom Chat Slack, or via text but when I say I don’t expect a response after hours, on a day off, on a weekend, whatever – I mean it. I just don’t want to forget something so I try to get it out there as soon as I can.

For team meetings, I prefer a detailed agenda, outcomes we can track, and a bit of a head’s up so I can come prepared whenever possible.

## Decision-Making Style

Diverse feedback and experience makes for a better journey. We may not have consensus but we can still collaborate. We all have opinions but data is often the key. I’ll ask where your information comes from, not to question its validity but to see how it was researched and if there is anything else we’re missing. 
Just because someone has always worked on something doesn’t mean they’re the best person to continue to work on that same thing. Differing viewpoints and experiences help us innovate.

While DACI and RACI may be seen as something for big organizations, even a small startup can benefit from knowing who needs to make the decisions to avoid a bottleneck.
Expectations and Feedback

I’m extremely transparent with my teams. I do believe in managers protecting their teams, but don’t believe in hiding or shielding them. We are all working toward the same goals, so I may be more candid than you’re used to. I may challenge you, or ask how you think we can work better together. I’ll admit when I’m wrong—I can’t learn to get better if I don’t know where I’m failing.

I believe the same for my team. Jonathan Raymond’s The Accountability Dial is an exceptional tool.  It emphasizes addressing issues in real-time by having direct, honest conversations as soon as something is noticed. It encourages taking immediate and constructive action to ensure problems are resolved quickly. 

I like to equate this to providing feedback at a restaurant. If the chef is putting too much salt on everything, if no one speaks up then they’ll keep doing it.  We can’t fix what we don’t know is broken. So I won’t wait until an annual review to provide feedback, it’s often too late at that point.

I may come across as defensive at times, as we all can, but I encourage that same level of feedback for me. And if I recognize that I was out of bounds or misspoke, I will own up to it. And I hope the teams I work with feel they can as well.

## Conclusion

I’m not perfect, I’m a human with human faults and an overwhelming passion for what I do. But I will always do the right thing – it may not be the easy thing, but I like sleeping soundly. If you have any questions about this, or you’ve worked with me previously and think I’ve missed something, please let me know. Text me at **314-225-5881** or email me info@daniellefavreau.com.

*We do what we know best to do at the time, when we know better we do better.*

### Addendum

Books that have changed me:

-	**Don’t Make Me Think** by Eric Krug
-	**Extreme Ownership** by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin
-	**Screw it Let’s Do It** by Richard Branson
-	**The Compound Effect** by Darren Hardy
-	**Deep Work** by Cal Newport
-	**Crucial Conversations** by Kerry Patterson
-	**Eight Dates** by John Gottman PhD, and Julie Schwartz Gottman PhD (while this is normally a book reserved for relationships, what it teaches us is that we have a lot to learn about those around us and sometimes their why can change everything).

### PS
I imagine you were expecting to see several repos waiting to be looked through, unfortunately, most of my code has been proprietary and is under contract. That said, I can show things during an interview. I like commenting my code and using the cleanest way to do things. I like to name things what they are, and prefer CamelCase.
